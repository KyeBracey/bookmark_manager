### Blog Post Regarding CRUD ###

*CRUD* (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
These are the four actions that can be taken on any database object

Create - Inputting new records
CREATE TABLE Students (ID int, Name varchar)

Read - Showing or viewing records
SELECT * FROM Students

Update - Changing records
UPDATE Students SET Name = 'Sam' WHERE Cohort = 'May 2017'

Delete - Remove object from the database
DELETE * FROM Students WHERE Banter = 'unsatisfactory'

*SQL* (Structured Query Language)
A database-specific language to be able to implement CRUD (but not much else)
